## Project Overview

### Project Details
This project is all about JavaScript programming, and it involves completing a series of tasks to improve your JavaScript skills. The tasks are designed to help you understand JavaScript basics, such as variables, data types, operators, loops, functions, and more.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both web development and general-purpose scripting. In this project, you will focus on learning JavaScript for the following purposes:

1. Scripting (similar to what you did with Python)
2. Web front-end development

The initial focus will be on scripting to grasp the fundamental concepts of the language. Later, you will apply your knowledge to make an Airbnb project dynamic using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without the help of Google:

### General
- Understand why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- Know how to run a JavaScript script.
- Create variables and constants.
- Differentiate between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- Identify all the data types available in JavaScript.
- Use `if` and `if...else` statements.
- Comment code effectively.
- Assign values to variables.
- Work with `while` and `for` loops.
- Utilize `break` and `continue` statements.
- Define what a function is and how to use functions.
- Explain the return value of a function that does not use any return statement.
- Understand the scope of variables.
- Know and use arithmetic operators.
- Manipulate dictionaries.
- Import external files.

## Requirements

### General
- Use editors such as `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Interpret your files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Ensure all your files end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should begin with `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- Ensure your code is semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x) with rules of Standard plus semicolons.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### More Info
- Install Node 14:
  ```bash
  $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
  $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```

- Install semistandard:
  ```bash
  $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
  ```

## Tasks

### Task 0: First Constant, First Print
- Create a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing."
- Use a constant variable named `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing."
- Print the output using `console.log(...)`.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### Task 1: 3 Languages
- Create a script that prints three lines:
  1. "C is fun"
  2. "Python is cool"
  3. "JavaScript is amazing"
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### Task 2: Arguments
- Create a script that prints a message depending on the number of arguments passed:
  - If no arguments are passed, print "No argument."
  - If only one argument is passed, print "Argument found."
  - Otherwise, print "Arguments found."
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- Utilize `process.argv`.

### Task 3: Value of My Argument
- Create a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
  - If no arguments are passed, print "No argument."
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
- You are not allowed to use `length`.

### Task 4: Create a Sentence
- Create a script that prints two arguments passed to it in the following format: "[arg1] is [arg2]."
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.

### Task 5: An Integer
- Create a script that prints "My number: [first argument converted to an integer]" if the first argument can be converted to an integer:
  - If the argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Not a number."
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
- You are not allowed to use try/catch.

### Task 6: Loop to Languages
- Create a script that prints three lines using an array of strings and a loop:
  1. "C is fun"
  2. "Python is cool"
  3. "JavaScript is amazing"
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
-

 You are not allowed to use any if/else statement.
- Use only one `console.log(...)`.
- Use a loop (while, for, etc.).

### Task 7: I Love C
- Create a script that prints "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument of the script.
  - If the first argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Missing number of occurrences."

- Use only two `console.log(...)`.
- Use a loop (while, for, etc.).

### Task 8: Square
