## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All code files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all code files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All code files must be executable.
- The length of your code files will be tested using the `wc` command.

### C Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All code files should end with a new line.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Each C code file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `lists.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- Ensure that all header files are include-guarded.
